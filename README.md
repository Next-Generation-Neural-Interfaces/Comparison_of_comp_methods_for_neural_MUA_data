Code and results from "Comparison of Data Compression Architectures for Neural Multi-Unit Activity Signals in Brain-Machine Interfaces" by Oscar Savolainen, Zheng Zhang, and Timothy Constandinou. In this work we proposed multiple state-of-the-art MUA compression schemes. We then compared their compression performance and hardware efficiency for different Binning Periods (BP), MUA dynamic ranges (S), number of channels and histogram sizes (used in a mapping/sorting module discussed in the paper).
